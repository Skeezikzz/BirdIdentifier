## **Technologies and Libraries Used**
- **Language**:
    - Python 3.12.8

- **Deep Learning Framework**:
    - PyTorch

- **Other Libraries**:
    - **NumPy** & **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
    - **Matplotlib**: Visualization of metrics (e.g., loss and accuracy curves)
    - **scikit-learn**: Evaluation metrics and data splitting
    - **OpenCV & PIL**: Image preprocessing

## **Challenges Encountered**
- **Large Number of Classes**: Training a model for 1500 classes required careful architecture design to handle high-dimensional outputs.
- **Overfitting**: Tackled overfitting with dropout layers, weight decay (L2 regularization), and a well-timed stop in training based on validation performance.
- **Training Bottlenecks**: Addressed slower improvements at later epochs with a **learning rate scheduler** and reduced learning rates to allow smoother convergence.

## **Next Steps and Future Improvements**
This model provides a strong foundation for large-scale image classification problems but can be further improved:
1. **Stronger Data Augmentation**: Add techniques like random cropping, rotation, flipping, and color jittering to improve robustness.
2. **Pretrained Models**: Fine-tune architectures like **ResNet**, **EfficientNet**, or **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for potentially better results.
3. **Class Rebalancing**: Further address imbalance in the training dataset using weighted loss functions or oversampling techniques.
4. **Per-Class Accuracy and Error Analysis**: Evaluate detailed class-wise performance and optimize for challenging classes.
5. **Ensemble Techniques**: Experiment with multiple models to create an ensemble for improved performance.
